this project is suppose to create a lot of instances to surf the play store and generate traffic to specific apps in the play store.


budoyoni is the manager and the budoyoni2 is the slave.


the project suppose to create every day a finite number of different instances - instances from different regions
and even different images (ubuntu windows and more) maybe later.
every time we change region we need to create another key pair and another user in IAM.
